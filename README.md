# Stock-Price Movement-Prediction-using-LSTM & Sentiment based Analysis using VADER
In this project , I've worked on time series data using a particular vintage time of any stock of your choice by creating a user engaged system and then predicted the opening prices of that stock based on previous 100 days data and predicted the prices i.e movement for the forthcoming week (future) 7 days. 
Also I used sentiments which was live scrapped from the finviz website which provides sentiments of that particular stock, and based on those sentiments I calculated the compound score for each of the sentiments and then , based on these sentiments my pricing movement was predicted from working on timeseries data as mentioned above.
